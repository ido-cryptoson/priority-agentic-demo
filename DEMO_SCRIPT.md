---

## PART 1: The Hook (1 minute)
**[Stay on Dashboard tab]**

> "Let me show you what ERP looks like when AI does the work and humans just approve."
>
> "This is Outsiders Israel - Saar Ltd - one of Priority's flagship customers. They run Columbia Sportswear across 52 stores, 64 POS stations, and 2 eCommerce sites."

**Point to the metrics bar:**
> "Right now, you can see they have some issues brewing:
> - Inventory Health at 72% - something's running low
> - ₪239K in AR at risk - customers not paying on time
>
> In a traditional ERP, someone would need to dig through reports to find these. Let me show you what's different."

---

## PART 2: Natural Language Intelligence (2 minutes)
**[Click "Ask AI" tab]**

> "Every employee becomes a data analyst. No SQL, no training, no waiting for IT."

**Click the suggested query: "What should I worry about this week?"**

Wait for response, then walk through:

> "The AI just analyzed inventory across all 52 stores, accounts receivable, and even network intelligence from other Priority customers."
>
> **Point to the response:**
> - "Bugaboo Winter Jackets - only 120 units left, selling 25 per day. That's less than 5 days before stockout - right before winter season."
> - "₪239K at risk from 4 B2B accounts - Outdoor Adventures Tours is 72 days overdue."
> - "Port congestion alert - this came from 89 OTHER Priority customers who reported delays."
>
> "This question would have taken a CFO 30 minutes to answer. We did it in 3 seconds."

**Optional - ask another question:**
> "Which products are at risk of stockout across our 52 stores?"

## PART 3: The Autonomous Agent (4 minutes) ⭐ CENTERPIECE
**[Click "AI Agents" tab - note the badge showing "3"]**

> "Now here's where it gets interesting. The AI doesn't just answer questions - it takes action."

**Point to the three pending actions:**

### Action 1: Abandoned Cart Recovery
> "The Collections Agent detected 127 abandoned carts worth ₪89,400 through Salesforce Commerce Cloud sync."
>
> "It's not just alerting us - it's drafted a recovery campaign and is waiting for approval."

**Click to expand the reasoning:**
> "Look at the agent's reasoning:
> - 127 carts abandoned in last 24 hours
> - Average cart value ₪704
> - Expected recovery rate 12-15%
> - Potential recovered revenue: ₪10,700-13,400
>
> The AI did the analysis. The human just decides: yes or no."

### Action 2: Winter Jacket PO (THE MAIN EVENT)
**Click to expand:**

> "This is the magic moment. The Inventory Agent detected we'll stockout in 4.8 days."
>
> "But it didn't just alert us - it:
> 1. Analyzed 4 different suppliers
> 2. Compared lead times, costs, quality ratings
> 3. Selected EU Warehouse - 7 day delivery, best cost-time balance
> 4. Drafted a purchase order for 500 units at $24,000
>
> **Point to the Approve button:**
> "One click. That's it. What used to take 2 hours across 3 departments is now 30 seconds of human oversight."

**Click "Approve" to demonstrate:**
> "Done. PO created, supplier notified, inventory system updated."

### Action 3: AR Collection
> "Same pattern - Collections Agent flagged Outdoor Adventures Tours, 72 days overdue, ₪67K outstanding. It's recommending a payment plan with 2% early payment discount."

**Key Message:**
> "The ERP did the work. The human made the decision. That's the future."

---

## PART 4: CRM Integration (1 minute)
**[Click "CRM" tab]**

> "Priority isn't just ERP - it's becoming the central nervous system."

**Point to the dual panels:**
> "On the left: Priority's native CRM with 847 B2B accounts - IDF, Nature & Parks Authority, Decathlon."
>
> "On the right: Salesforce Commerce Cloud with 45,000 B2C profiles syncing through Priority's OneCore engine."

**Point to Customer 360:**
> "We have a complete view - Sarah Cohen bought ₪2,340 in the last year, she's a Gold loyalty member, and we know her preferences."

> "This is why Priority wins in retail - it connects everything."

---

## PART 5: Network Intelligence - The Moat (1.5 minutes)
**[Click "Network Intel" tab]**

> "Here's the competitive moat that makes this defensible."

**Point to the network visualization:**
> "Priority sees patterns across 17,000+ companies. Every node is a Priority customer sharing anonymized intelligence."

**Point to the alerts:**
> "Look at this:
> - Port of Rotterdam delays - detected by 12 Priority customers in Europe
> - Textile prices up 8% - our Turkish supplier will likely raise prices
> - Ashdod Port congestion - 89 customers flagged this
>
> "When one Priority customer experiences a supply chain issue, the entire network learns. NetSuite and SAP can't build this - they don't have the density."

**Key message:**
> "This is intelligence no single company could build alone. Every new customer makes the network smarter."

---

## PART 6: The Close (30 seconds)

> "Let me leave you with three things:
>
> **1. Time Savings:** 2 hours becomes 30 seconds per decision
>
> **2. Switching Cost:** Customers don't leave their AI workforce. Churn goes to near-zero.
>
> **3. Pricing Power:** AI agents command premium pricing - 30-50% uplift potential
>
> "This isn't Priority Software anymore. This is **Priority Intelligence** - the autonomous operating system for the mid-market."

## Backup Q&A Points

| "What about hallucinations?" | "RAG architecture - AI only answers from actual company data, not imagination." |
| "Competition?" | "SAP/Oracle move slowly. Their bureaucracy is our advantage." |
| "Customer reception?" | "Reduces training costs, increases adoption. Users love not learning SQL." |
| "M&A synergy?" | "Every acquired company (like Expo-Net) instantly gets agentic capabilities." |
